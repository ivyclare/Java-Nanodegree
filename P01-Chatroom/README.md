# Chat Room
Complete the chat room application implementation using WebSocket.

In this project, I built a web-based chat room application using Spring Boot and websocket components. Here, I implemented the message model and controller and used Thymeleaf to create web pages to build the user login flow and chat room interface.

## Background
WebSocket is a communication protocol that makes it possible to establish a two-way communication channel between a
server and a client.

## Instruction
### Implement the message model
Message model is the message payload that will be exchanged between the client and the server. Implement the Message
class in chat module. Make sure you cover all there basic actions.
1. JOIN
2. CHAT
3. LEAVE

### Complete WebSocketChatServer
Implement all TODOs inside WebSocketChatServer follow each method description.

### Run the application with command
mvn build; mvn spring-boot:run
